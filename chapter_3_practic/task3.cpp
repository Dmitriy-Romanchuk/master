﻿//Operators such as >> , which read input from the keyboard, must be able to convert a
//series of digits into a number.Write a program that does the same thing.It should allow
//the user to type up to six digits, and then display the resulting number as a type long
//integer.The digits should be read individually, as characters, using getche().
//Constructing the number involves multiplying the existing value by 10 and then adding
//the new digit. (Hint: Subtract 48 or ‘0’ to go from ASCII to a numerical digit.)

	// In the heyday of the British empire, Great Britain used a monetary system based on pounds, shillings, and pence.
	// There were 20 shillings to a pound, and 12 pence to a shilling.The notation for this old system used the pound sign, £, and two decimal points,
	// so that, for example, £5.2.8 meant 5 pounds, 2 shillings, and 8 pence. (Pence is the plural of penny.) 
	// The new monetary system, introduced in the 1950s, consists of only pounds and pence, with 100 pence to a pound(like U.S.dollars and cents).
	// We’ll call this new system decimal pounds.Thus £5.2.8 in the old notation is £5.13 in decimal pounds(actually £5.1333333).
	// Write a program to convert the old pounds - shillings - pence format to decimal pounds.An example of the user’s interaction with the program would be
	// Enter pounds : 7
	// Enter shillings : 17
	// Enter pence : 9
	// Decimal pounds = £7.89
	// In most compilers you can use the decimal number 156 (hex character constant ‘\x9c’)
	// to represent the pound sign(£).In some compilers, you can put the pound sign into your
	// program directly by pasting it from the Windows Character Map accessory.
